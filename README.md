# Snake-Game
The Snake game is a classic arcade game that originated in the late 1970s. It gained widespread popularity in the 1990s when it was included on Nokia mobile phones. The objective of the game is simple: control a snake that grows longer as it eats food, with the goal of avoiding collisions with the walls of the playing area or with the snake's own tail.
The game typically features a grid-based playing area with the snake represented as a line or series of connected blocks. As the snake consumes food, its length increases, making it progressively more challenging to navigate without running into itself or the boundaries. The game ends when the snake collides with itself or the boundaries of the playing area.
